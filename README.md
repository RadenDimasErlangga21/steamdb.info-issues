### Intro
This tool was made to give better insight into the applications and packages that [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) has in its database. We go by **Steam Database**, or simply **SteamDB**, if you'd like. We are not affiliated with Valve in any way. Apps and packages in the database will update the second Steam sends out the update to the Steam client.
